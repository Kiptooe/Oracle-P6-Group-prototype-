# Oracle-P6-Group-prototype-
This is a repository containing UI Designs and Slides presented by my group in the Oracle Primavera P6 Project Management Bootcamp Hackathon.

## SDG's Addressed
SDG 1 - No Poverty
SDG 2 - Zero Hunger
SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth

## Proposed solution
My team wasn't able to use the P6 tool due to difficulties accessing it. However, we understand how projects are scheduled using P6 and used that knowledge to manually schedule our project. Such as:

1. Naming our project
2. Recording activities
3. Identifying dependencies
4. Creating a schedule 

The proposed solution was an e-commerce web application called EcoBeads. It's main purpose would be to allow craftswomen sell their products through the platform. The platform will allow buyers worldwide to purchase the women's products. A unique feature in the proposed solution is a feature for buyers to make customised orders. Due to many buyers preferring custom products, this feature shall increase the earning potential of the women.
